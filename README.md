Challenge #1 - University of Richmond's Coding Bootcamp

This is the first challenge available for the 2021 cohort of University of Richmond's Coding Bootcamp.

We were tasked with the following objective of refactoring an existing site to make it more assessible.

Acceptance Criteria include:
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
